			<div class="lybMar-btm lybMar-top">
				<p></p>
				<ol>
					<li>Lean Red Meat: Steak contains a ton of protein and iron. Red meat is high in cholesterol, so most food professionals donâ€™t recommend it as part of a healthy diet more than a few times per week. </li>
					<li>Real Nut Butters: Natural peanut butter is packed with protein and fats, making it a great choice for people trying to gain weight the healthy way. One tablespoon contains around 100 calories and has 4 grams of protein. </li>
					<li>Whole Fat Milk: Dietitians say that one simple substitution you can make when trying to gain weight is swapping your skim milk for whole milk. Itâ€™s only 60 calories more a glass as the fat is left in. </li>
					<li>Tropical Fruit: Fruits like mango, papaya, bananas, and pineapple are amazing choices according to food experts. They are full of natural sugars and can give you great energy. </li>
					<li>Avocado: These delicious green vegetables are an excellent way to add heart-healthy fats to your diet. One half of an avocado contains 140 calories, but also contain high levels of potassium, folic acid, and vitamin E. </li>
					<li>Natural Granola: Natural granola with no added refined sugar is a great cereal to enjoy if you are trying to gain weight. This tasty snack is made from rolled oats, sugar, and healthy fats (like nuts and coconut oil). More dried fruit and nuts can also be added. </li>
					<li>Whole Wheat Bread: Nutritionists say that eating healthy bread products is a great way to start gaining weight. If youâ€™re adding bread to your diet, look for whole grains. Nuts: Nuts are a great snack for gaining weight. They are full of fat and nutrients, but also contain a great deal of fiber. Eating only a handful of nuts can keep you full for hours. Not all nuts are equal for fiber though.</li>
					<li>Cheese: Try goat cheese with eggs, Swiss with roasted chicken, and Parmesan on top of asparagus. On its own, cheese also makes a great snack because itâ€™s high in protein.</li>
